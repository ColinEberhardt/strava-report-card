Create an interesting and engaging narrative for a cyclist based on their annual cycling statistics.

name: Jerry
gender: M
distance: 1,740 miles
distance comparison:  cycle around the world in 14 years
total rides: 251 
hours ride: 261
streak: 11
climb: 9,723 metres
climb comparison: El Capitan four times
classification: extreme cyclist
narrative: In the last year Jerry has been on an impressive 251 rides, covering a total of 1,740 miles over 261 non-stop hours. His longest cycling streak is 11 days, that's a lot of consecutive days hitting the road (or trail). If he keeps clocking up this mileage he'll have cycled round the world in 14 years, we think that's an achievable goal. We'd classify Jerry as an extreme cyclist, clocking up an eye-watering number of miles. During these rides he has climbed 9,723 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing El Capitan four times (but a bit less steep).

name: Julie
gender: F
distance: 180 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in 3 years
total rides: 54
hours ride: 86
streak: 2
climb: 2,316 metres
climb comparison: Snowdon two times
classification: recreational cyclist
narrative: In the last year Julie has been on a very respectable 54 rides, covering a total of 180 miles over 86 hours. Her longest cycling streak is just 2 days, c'mon Julie, you don't need those rest days! If she keeps clocking up this mileage she'll have cycled the length of the UK in three years, that's pretty good going, start booking those B&Bs. We'd classify Julie as a dedicated recreational cyclist, clocking up a decent mileage. During these rides she has climbed 2,316 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon two times (but a bit less cold).

name: Ed
gender: M
distance: 434 miles
distance comparison: the width of the USA in 7 years
total rides: 128 rides
hours ride: 85
streak: 4 
climb: 3,916 metres
climb comparison: climbing Snowdon four times
classification: serious cyclist
narrative: In the last year Ed has been on a very respectable 128 rides, covering a total of 434 miles over 85 hours. His longest cycling streak is 4 days, ride-sleep-eat-repeat! If he keeps clocking up this mileage he'll have cycled the width of the USA in seven years, sounds like a fun challenge. We'd classify Ed as a serious cyclist, I bet he keeps a close eye on his achievements. During these rides he has climbed 3,916 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon four times (without catching the train).

name: Sara
gender: F
distance: 311 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in three years
total rides: 79 rides
hours ride: 73
streak: 3 
climb: 3,786 metres
climb comparison: climbing Snowdon three times
classification: recreational cyclist
narrative: We've looked at the data and can see that Sara has pulled on her cycling gear 79 times this year, clocking up 73 hours of total riding time and covering a distance of 311 miles. If she keeps this up she'll have cycled the length of the UK in three years, that sounds like an achievable goal. Based on our assessment, Sara is a recreational cyclist, she's not letting it take over her whole life! During these rides she has climbed 3,786 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon three times, worth it for the view.

name: Sam
gender: unknown
distance: 211 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in five years
total rides: 49 rides
hours ride: 43
streak: 1 
climb: 2,786 metres
climb comparison: climbing Snowdon once
classification: recreational cyclist
narrative: We've looked at the data and can see that Sam has pulled on their cycling gear 49 times this year, clocking up 43 hours of total riding time and covering a distance of 211 miles, that's a fairly modest number of miles. If they keep this up they'll have cycled the length of the UK in five years, that's a big commitment. Sam is a recreational cyclist, they clearly have other things to do with their time! During these rides they have climbed 2,786 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon just once, but once is enough!
